* identifiers --> $, _
* keyword --> var, function, if, etc.
* what is javascript literals and variables ?
* what is the difference between expression and statement?
* It is a good practice to declare all the variables at beginning of a script
* if we re declare the variable, it will not loose it's value
	EX:-
		var carName = "Volvo";
		var carName;
		
* x + = y ------> x = x + Y (this can be used for strings )

* what is the diff between typeof and instaceof ?

* exponentiation operator(**):- raises the first operand to the power of the second operand
	EX:-
		var x = 5;
		var y = x ** 2;	// result is 25 --- 5*5
		

* ===  --> strict equal
* !==  --> strict unequal

* javascript data types are object, number, string, boolean etc.
* the typeof function will returns the function not object
	EX:-
		typeof function employee(){} 	--> returns function
		
* we can access the object property in two ways

	1. person.firstName
	2. person['firstName]
	
*  In a function definition, this refers to the 'owner' of the function.
*  In a method, this refers to the owner object.
*  In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
*  when this is used alone, the owner is global object, so this refers to the global object
	Ex:-
		function employee(firstName, lastName) {
			this.firstName = firstName;
			this.lastName = lastName;
			this.getFullName = function() {
				return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
			}
		}
